abstract = {Knowledge about genetic variability of a crop allows for more efficient and effective use of resources in plant improvement programs. The genetic variation within temperate maize has been studied extensively, but the levels and patterns of diversity in tropical maize are still not well understood. Brazilian maize germplasm represents a very important pool of genetic diversity due to many past introductions of exotic material. To im- prove our knowledge of the genetic diversity in tropical maize inbred lines, we fingerprinted 85 lines with 569 AFLP bands and 50 microsatellite loci. These markers revealed substantial variability among lines, with high rates of polymorphism. Cluster analysis was used to identify groups of related lines. Well-defined groups were not observed, indicating that the tropical maize studied is not as well organized as temperate maize. Three types of genetic distance measurements were ap- plied (Jaccard’s coefficient, Modified Rogers’ distance and molecular coefficient of coancestry), and the values obtained with all of them indicated that the genetic similarities were small among the lines. The different coefficients did not substantially affect the results of cluster analysis, but marker types had a large effect on genetic similarity estimates. Regardless of genetic simi- larity coefficient used, estimates based on AFLPs were poorly correlated with those based on SSRs. Analyses using AFLP and SSR data together do not seem to be the most efficient manner of assessing variability in highly diverse materials because the result was similar to using AFLPs alone. It was seen that molecular markers can help to organize the genetic variability and expose useful diversity for breeding purposes.},
